# odin-todo-list

Initial ideal for this project.

1.User can navigate between all projects that he is appended to
2.Inside project there are 3 tabs. Todo, doing and done.
3.It's possible to create new project, update them, remove
4.Ability to move todo's between projects

Project properties:
-Name
-{todo}
-current state e.g.("7/12 completed" or "5 to complete")

Todo's properties:
-Title DONE
-description DONE
-creation date DONE
-deadline date DONE
-priority (low, moderate, high) DONE

App stores Projects, Todo's and users as objects.
All of them can be created with factories.

Być może wystarczy zrobić dom funkcje która zamiast dodawać divy będzie dodawała tyle divów ile jest pozycji w array 'projects'
